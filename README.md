## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I am new to Front-end development. Thanks to this challenge, I improve my skills on mostly in CSS. Previously, I have used Bootstap to achive a simple card look. However, this time I used only CSS and this helped me to improve my skills on CSS. Also, I have not use Flexbox in my own project before, so it was nice to see it works in actual projects.



### Continued development

This project was not responsive, therefore, in the future, I would like to make responsive sites and more complex overviews. Moreover, I would like to use grid, and make more eye-catchy web pages.
